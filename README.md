# Rating_App
This full-stack web app uses FastAPI (backend), Streamlit (frontend), and MySQL to manage store ratings. Users can sign up, log in, view stores, and submit ratings, with average ratings displayed dynamically. The project showcases end-to-end development with REST APIs, authentication, state management, and relational database handling.
